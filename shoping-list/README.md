# Shoping List

Vanilla JavaScript shopping list app from my Modern JS From The Beginning course.

This project is created to focus on working with the DOM, events, state, local storage and other fundamentals of JavaScript.

Add items to list via form.

Remove items from list by clicking the "X" button.

Clear all items with "clear" button.

Filter the items by typing in the filter field.

Add localStorage to persist items.

Click on an item to put into "edit mode" and add to form.

Update item.

Deploy to Netlify.
